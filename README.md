# HexadecimalServer
A Java application that implements a server, which responds to requests with a random hexadecimal number of length 32.

## Running the Application
* Open a command line in the ***dist*** folder of the repository.
* Execute the following command:<br/>
  `Java –jar httpserver.jar –port n`
  * If the parameter ***port*** is given, it should be followed by the parameter ***n***, where ***n*** is the port number on which the server will listen for requests.  If these parameters are not included in the command, the default port number will be ***8888***.
